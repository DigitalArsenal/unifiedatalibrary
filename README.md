## Description

The demo page can simulate a phishing attack by prompting users to enter their credentials (username and password). **Important:** The credentials are not stored or transmitted anywhere; they are only displayed in an alert box within the browser for demonstration purposes. 

## Usage

To use the demo page, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unifiedatalibrary.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd unifiedatalibrary
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the demo page.

## Files

### `index.html`

This file contains the HTML and JavaScript code for the demo page. The page includes:

- A custom login prompt that mimics the appearance of a real login form.
- A script that displays the entered credentials (partially masked) in an alert box.
- Links to resources for learning more about phishing.

## Security Note

The credentials entered into the demo page are only displayed within an alert box and never leave the browser. This ensures that no sensitive information is transmitted or stored.
